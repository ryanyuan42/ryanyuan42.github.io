Hi Ryan,

Recently I got overwhelmed by job searching and even forgot the purpose of being here. I nearly start to wonder what I should do if I don't
get a job, what would happen if I don't get admitted by Ph.D., how sad it would be to go back and start a job and just become used to a 9 to 5 
life.   

Today, somehow, I started to code to implement word2vec with C#. And suddenly I realized that it's not finding a job that drives me, it is
doing these kind of nerdy and cool things that drives me. I didn't major in any related quantitative area in undergraduate. It's the curiosity
of trying to know what's under the models that keeps me going. Finding a job, of course, is important. But I am only 22 and I am going to finish
a master degree. Finding a job or not, does it really matter? Or is it just something that everybody else is doing and that peer pressure drives 
me mad? How could I forget why I got into this journey in the first place?  

Not getting a job, so what? Not getting admitted to Ph.D., so what? I could still research on my own. I could still read articles and code 
fun stuff and even forget my dinner 3 years ago then I could still do that now. Be prepare for the interview and application, but don't get
desperate during the process. After all, it's for fun and it also should be fun. And now, with the extra time every day, I could focus on 
a lot more stuff I am interested. Java, C++, derivative pricing, machine learning, natural language processing, so many interesting topics 
are waiting for me to discover. Why waste time complaining about life?

Enjoy and stay hopeful.  

Hope you won't forget why you begin again.  

Best,
Ryan Yuan
