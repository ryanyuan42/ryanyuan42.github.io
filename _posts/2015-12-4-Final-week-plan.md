##Review Plan
* I've got 13 days left for two subjects, Tax and Advanced Accounting
* I can make 10 days for them or 11 days for them.
* In the 11 days,

###Tax
Chapter 13, 14, 15 and Chapter 5, 6, 8

###Advanced Accounting
Chapter 16, 17, 18, 9

11 days or so should be good to deal with these.

Therefore, I still get 2 or 3 days to read Machine Learning. 

###GRE
What should I do about GRE?

I think I should give myself a full month to memorize the vocabulary or do it every night. Maybe 3 units every night. 

###Machine Learning

I don't know if Machine Learning is more important to a quant or Data Mining. But since I only get the book apropos ML , I will study Machine Learning now. 

This should be a great plan and hopefully I can do it good. 

###Winter Break Project

And I wish that I can do a project related to Machine Learning or Data Mining this week and maybe about financial data, like foreign currency trading? 
But I actually and another project in mind, which is to study the situation of the weather in Beijing. 
Try to use the big data to find out the reason of a sudden aaggravation of the haze in the air of Shanghai and Beijing.

Or, maybe I can get down to that specific area, like digging down the relationship between the economic and the haze ?
What is the effect of shutting down factory that may cause the haze?
Or even better, choosing one speicific industry, like oil or coal? 

That should be an interesting topic if I can apply Machine Learning or Data Mining on that.

Cool.
